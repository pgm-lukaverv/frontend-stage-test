Star Wars Team Builder is a modern web application that lets you assemble your own squad of Star Wars characters. The app is designed for fans who want to explore, select, and manage their favorite heroes and villains in a fun, interactive way.

## Features

- **Team Management:** Add up to five non-evil characters to your team. Remove members and see your team update instantly.
- **Evil Detection:** Characters marked as evil cannot be added to your team, keeping your squad on the light side.

- **Image Fallback:** If a character image is missing or broken, a fallback image from the public folder is shown automatically.
- **Responsive Design:** The app works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Persistence:** Your team is saved in local storage, so it remains intact across page reloads and browser sessions.
