# Starwars Front-end Coding Test
**Intro**

In this technical front-end developer test, you're going to build a simple application. The objective is to test your skills, to measure how you solve coding challenges and do research.

We’re open to feedback regarding this exercise.

Your code will be evaluated according to following criteria:

- JavaScript/TypeScript usage
- Correct framework usage
- State management
- Coding style (we like clean code)
- Solution & architecture design
- CSS (library) usage

**Requirements**

We’re assembling a team to fight the dark side! Our application will assist us in creating a team of maximum 5 Star Wars characters. Our team is determined to eradicate evil, which means **no evil members are allowed to join**. 

- Create an application that shows a list of Star Wars characters
- The application should have a detail page for every character
- Each detail page shows some basic information about the selected character (name, image, height, mass, affiliations)
- Each detail page has a next and previous button to navigate between characters
- Each detail page allows us to add and/or remove the selected character from our team
- The application should have a team page showing your assembled team. We should be able to remove characters from our team from this page as well.
- We should be able to see and manage our assembled team from every page
- A team has max. 5 members
- Style the application (pure css or a library)

A character is defined as evil when:

- They have ‘Darth’ or ‘Sith’ in their name
- They have at least one affiliation that mentions ‘Darth’ or ‘Sith’ 
  (you may ignore former affiliations)
- They have at least one master with ‘Darth’ in their name

**Some ideas to earn bonus points**

1. Pagination for main list of characters
1. Create (unit) tests for your components and/or business logic
1. Add prettier and/or linting
1. Use your creativity to add a personal touch

**Final steps**

1. Add some documentation in a README file
1. If you are using AI (which is probably the case), then list the prompt you used.

Good luck, and may the code be with you!
